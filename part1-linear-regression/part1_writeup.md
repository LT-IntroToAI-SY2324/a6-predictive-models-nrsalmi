# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?

The r squared value is 0.6257932855322312 which means the relationship is not very related to each other

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?

Prediction when someone is 43: 137.46185286

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

The models predictions are not too accurate as seen by our r^2 value and although there is some relationship I wouldnt consider it accurate enough to determine accurately enough. Increasing data could help determine a better line of best fit.
