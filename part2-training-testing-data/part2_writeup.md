# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?

Training data can help it be better at predicting values.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?

the closer the r squared coefficient is to one, the more accurate it is at finding a correlation and in this case our r^2 value was slightly better sowing a better correlation

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.

I would not say our model is accurate but I would say it is more accurate than our original because it's value is closer to 1.
