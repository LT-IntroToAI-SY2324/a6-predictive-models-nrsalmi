# Part 4 - Classification Writeup

After completing `a6_part4.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Comment out the StandardScaler and re-run your test. How accurate is the model? Why is that?

The model is less accurate because not all the data is equal in their weight

2. How accurate is the model with the StandardScaler? Is this model accurate enough for the given use case? Explain.

The model's accuracy is under 0.8 which is close to 1 meaning the model is fairly accurate. The model should be accurate enough for this case as the results do not need to be exact but more so a close guess.

3. Looking at the predicted and actual results, how did the model do? Was there a pattern to the inputs that the model was incorrect about?

The predictions and actual results when compared were close in their values but outliers can mess this data up.

4. Would a 34 year old Female who makes 56000 a year buy an SUV according to the model? Remember to scale the data before running it through the model.

No she would not buy the suv
