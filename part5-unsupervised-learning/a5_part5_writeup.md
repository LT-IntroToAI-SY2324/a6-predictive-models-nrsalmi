## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.

The bottom left would be called "frugal" because they make the least amount of money but they also save among the most. The center would be "typical" because the spend about how much they make. The top left would be "Crashing" becauese they're income is the lowest and they're burning all their money. The top right would be "ballers" because they make a lot and spend a lot like ballers. Bottom right would be "Savers" because they make a lot but save alot of it too.

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?

They would probably be in the bottom right group.

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?

The top right group would probably be the best to target high value clothing whose name brands would appeal to them especially since they make and spend a lot.
